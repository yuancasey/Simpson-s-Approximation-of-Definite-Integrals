# Simpson-s-Approximation-of-Definite-Integrals
Simpson's rule is defined as follows:
Simpson’s rule for approximating definite integrals: 􏰆b ∆x
where
and
f(x)dx≈ 3 (1f(x0)+4f(x1)+2f(x2)+4f(x3)+2f(x4)+...+2f(xN−2)+4f(xN−1)+1f(xN)) a
∆x = b − a N
xi =a+i∆x

The program will asks the user to enter in A, B and an even integer N, and uses Simpson’s rule with N intervals to approximate the value of
􏰆B 1 −x2/2
√ e dx.
